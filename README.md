# Integral Cryptanalysis Using Algebraic Transition Matrices
This repository is supplementary material to the paper "Integral Cryptanalysis Using Algebraic Transition Matrices" by Tim Beyne and Michiel Verbauwhede.

To run the code, make sure all requirements in `requirements.txt` are installed through pip.
Also make sure to compile the code in `bitarrays`.

The code related to the cryptanalysis of PRESENT can be found under `Ciphers/PRESENT`.

`Invariants.ipynb` requires the sagemath kernel.
